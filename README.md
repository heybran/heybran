### Hi there 👋

I'm Brandon, a developer based in China. I have a strong passion for creating user-friendly and accessible websites. I'm a big fan of using technologies that adhere to web standards, such as Web Components. 

Currently, I'm working on a project called [Cucumber Components](https://github.com/heybran/cucumber-components). It is a vanilla Web Components collections. But, during the course of this project, I have realized the vast amount of web accessibility knowledge I don't have in this area. So, I am circling back to the basics and immersing myself in learning web accessibility. I like to read tech blogs and design systems. I am also engaging with folks on Mastodon around general web development.

I'm also working on migrating my [personal website](https://heybran.cn/). It is currently styled with Tailwind CSS. I'm replacing Tailwind with Web Components. So, I can trim down one more dependency. 

I listen to front-end Podcasts on a daily basis. This is [a list of Podcasts](https://heybran.cn/resources/) that I listen to. I also enjoy screencasting web development tutorials and exploring new technologies. Additionally, I have a keen interest in photography. I own an entry-level Canon DSLR camera. These are some of the [back and white photos](https://heybran.cn/photography/) that I have took over the past few years.
